## Disclaimer

Today, I share a different path. A path of defying norms, of finding your niche, of harnessing open-source. A path that turns your portfolio into your power.

This is my story. It might not be for everyone, but it could be yours.

## The Power of Open Source

Open-source is more than code. It's a **boost for your skills**, a **spotlight on your niche**, a **toolbox for your projects**. It's a **job fair**. It's a **team sport**.

> "Opportunity often looks like work." -- Thomas Edison

## The Power of an Open-Source Portfolio

An open-source portfolio is your secret weapon.

It makes you more hireable, more discoverable by recruiters. It turns you into a standout candidate. It can even let you bypass technical tests.

In short, it's your ticket to a successful career in IT.

## Stand Out from the Crowd

Don't be just another student. Don't be _'I do C and Go'_. That's common. 

Be unique. Be invaluable. Stand out.

## Fear of Open-Source 1/2

Open-source can be scary. Building in public? Showing your flaws? It's daunting. But perfection isn't the goal here. Good intentions are.

Whether it's your own repo or someone else's, as long as you follow the contributing guidelines, you'll be welcomed, not insulted. And who knows, you might even get merged.

## The Balancing Act

School projects. Personal growth. A tricky juggle. Time's tight, deadlines clash, focus wavers. But remember, nothing worth having comes easy. It's a challenge, not an impossibility.

Take the leap. Release your school projects or side projects on GitHub. It's your stage to shine, to show what you're capable of.

Don't just stop at your projects. Give back to the community. Found a flaw? Make a pull request. Even a small fix counts. Take that first step.

## Do You Enjoy IT?

Maybe you love IT school, or maybe you're happy as a cog in a big IT machine. That's okay.

But if you crave advanced IT and challenges, consider this: being the best student isn't always the best path. Your time is precious. Use it wisely.

## Test the Waters

How can you tell if IT is right for you? Take it for a test drive.

An internship is a great opportunity to try it out.

Dive into open-source, attend meetups, engage in IT beyond school. It's the ideal way to discover if you're passionate about the work or just the learning process.

## Conclusion

Remember my disclaimer. This is my journey, and the journey of many I've worked with.

You have a choice. Embrace the comfort of big groups and a straightforward professional life. Or dive deeper, strive to become a recognized developer.

The beauty of open-source? It's a no-strings-attached deal. Give it a shot, and if it's not for you, you can always step back. Your journey, your rules.
